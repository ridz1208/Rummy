<p>For the term project, we will design, implement, and test a complete version of the game of <a href="http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html">gin rummy</a>. The goal of the project is to give you hands-on experience in developing a quality software product using advanced object-oriented concepts and state-of-the-art software engineering tools.</p>
<h2>Application Domain</h2>
<p>Gin rummy is a two-player game played with a 52-card deck. The goal of the game is to assemble a player's 10-card hand into <i>runs</i> and <i>groups</i> of cards to minimize the number of points associated with <i>unmatched cards</i>.</p>
<p>We will use <a href="http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ginrummy.html">this site</a> as the official specification of the rules of the game.</p>
<p>Our implementation of the game will pit a human player against the computer.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you have never played gin rummy before. In-depth knowledge of gaming strategies is not necessary to complete the project. A summary of the basics of the game and hints about strategies will be covered in class.</p>
<h2>Project Architecture</h2>
<p>Figure 1 shows the architecture for the project. Your final design should follow this architecture. The <b>AI</b> package will implement the behavior of the computer player(s). The <b>model</b> package will group all the classes necessary to maintain the status of the game and carry out actions related to the game. Finally, the <b>UI</b> package will contain all the classes required to implement the user interface. An additional <b>util</b> package will contain the utility classes (not shown).</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The project will follow a simple development process consisting of <b>milestones</b>. A milestone is a coherent set of deliverables that form a working (but not necessarily complete) version of the product. Information on each milestone will be posted separately.</p>
<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>You are encouraged to work in teams of two or three. This team size should lead to the best software development outcome, and allow you to gain valuable experience in collaborative software development. However, all team members must complete the learning objectives of the project. To create a team, self-enrol the group using the group tool. A TA will send you information to create your server space.</p>
